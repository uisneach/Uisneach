# The Genetic Makeup of the Great American Race

{% asset_img Pioneers.jpg %}

## Background

Yes, “American” is a race, or rather, a family of smaller races which find their origins among Enagland and Wales, Scotland, Ireland, France, Germany, Denmark, and Norway. There are other populations in the United States today, but I will be focusing on the American race.

From the earliest times, the American race has been a mirror of Western and Northern Europe in the New World. A proposed seal for the United States, drawn in 1776 by Pierre du Simitière, is shown below, which shows the six nations which were taken as the origin of the colonial American population: England (and Wales), Scotland, Ireland, France, Holland, and Germany. As we will see, this characterization is accurate. Some people will try to convince you that America was an Anglo-Saxon ethnostate before Germans, Irish, and Italians moved in. This is not true. Britain has, however, always been the largest substrate for most of the population.

The genetics paper this article is drawing data from is [“Clustering of 770,000 genomes reveals post-colonial population structure of North America”](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14238) by Han et al, published in Nature on Feb 7, 2017. These researchers took 769,444 DNA samples from Ancestry.com data; 96% of the people sampled had ancestors who were born within the US. From this dataset, we get a canvas showing the large swaths of White American population movement surrounded by a smattering of niche genetic groups across the continent, including Caribbeans, Acadians, and Mexicans. On Ancestry.com, you can also set your ‘pedigree’, or the locations your ancestors were born. This is a great help, because we can now identify the movement of people over time, not simply where they are now. All data and figures in this writeup come from this paper or its supplementary material. Most samples are from California, followed by New York and Texas.

Another great thing about this study is that they trace ‘identity-by-descent’ data, instead of ‘identity-by-state’. An IBD analysis tracks DNA segments that are not merely similar, but are descended from the same ancestor. This is a sample of how clusters are calculated across individuals in this sizeable dataset.

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmaGd7XoAIdBmm.png)

First let's see the PCA distribution. Below we see participants grouped into states and mapped based on genetic similarity. For the non-initiated, distance in this graphic roughly represents total genetic distance between populations. You can see that California, New York, and Texas are largest, followed by PA, MI, and IL, etc. The far Northeast and the Deep South both form highly differentiated clusters form ing two ends of the spectrum. The Mid-Atlantic and Upper South cluster closer to the West of the country. We can already see historic movements: notice that Utah is close to New York, for example, a remnant of Mormonism's origins in upstate NY before moving out west. These clusters will color all future maps in this paper.

![PCA Chart](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmauz2WYAAlP7T.jpg)

The primary map is below, the one which merits reposting again and again. The DNA data clusters into the groups shown above, which are then color-coded here based on genetic similarity only, not geographic origin. Those groups are the American sub-races. But what does this graphic show? There are three things going on with each dot: color, size, and location. The dot does *not* represent a participant in this study, but rather the participant's parents or other ancestors. Each dot's location show the participant's *parent's* birthplace. Size indicates the number of birth locations reported for that area. Color represents the nearest genetic cluster which participants from that area associate with. So if you're DNA clustered with the blue datapoints, you would likely be from Pennsylvania, if yellow, likely from the coastal South.

Alongside that larger map is another showing smaller clusters or sub-races which the researchers picked up in finer detail.

![Ancestry Distribution #2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmaoC5XMAEItnw.jpg)

---------

In the end, yes, this is a map of the American sub-races. But it implies that the Western US is totally uninhabited, which is why you must understand that this shows only your ancestor’s birth locations. Larger circle = more reported birth locations there.

There we have it: the five largest genetic groups of America are New England / Utah, Pennsylvania, Lower Midwest / Appalachia, Upper South, and Lower South. All true Americans come from one or some of these races. But the story gets more complex.

This is the true PCA chart for the American nation. New England seems to be its own ethnostate, just as the deep South is. The rest of the country is somewhat homogeneous. See how the French of Louisiana drag their state towards the French of New England. https://t.co/E3ERrBKPGi

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmauz2WYAAlP7T.jpg)

But this hardly answers the issue of where these populations came from. Let’s see some global admixture data on the groups here. See the column ‘Global Admixture’ and most of the American population groups are simply ‘Western European’ &gt;75%. https://t.co/xgpQoUKWv7

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRma4r6WUAAj0_N.png)

What is Western Europe here? Luckily the researchers define it in this map. It covers Madrid to Warsaw, and a bit of Southern England. ‘Britain’ encloses all of the Netherlands and most of northern France.

So clearly these are genetic regions, not strict political borders, to account for similarities between neighbors, ancient migrations, etc. Thankfully in the Supplementary Material, they give us additional maps in fine geographic detail.

Notice also that Irish, Scandinavian, Mennonites, Amish are separated in the table above. Why is that? It’s not because they don’t make up a component of the American Race, but because in some areas they’ve remained so isolated it’s possible to draw them out from other clusters.

In fact, we have these spectral analysis charts which show how far out from the mean each ethnos goes. Jews and Africans are very distinct from Americans, while Scandinavians, Amish, Irish, and Mormons are distinct but not very divergent. https://t.co/i3EmVMeGlY

Look again on this map. The populations begin on the eastern seaboard, and migrate west with almost no north-south movement. “Go West Young Man” was apparently taken literally. We are given data on the latitude and longitude of ancestors as they moved generations ago. https://t.co/JB4Ms1FNab

Now, we are about to dive into a long series of maps going into extreme detail on the migratory patterns of these American sub-races. First, let’s examine a sub-race as practice: Cajuns, Acadians, and French Canadians.

See here how many Cajuns and Acadians list their ancestors from 1649 - 1791 as being born in Louisiana and French Canada, but also many in France. Clearly the pink ancestors still had some migrating to do. https://t.co/tw2H35v1wo

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmcvsoXEAEuk0A.jpg)

Notice how between the 6-9th generations and the 3-5th generations, the large blue dots move from Nova Scotia to Louisiana. This is because in the mid-1700s, the British expelled the French from Nova Scotia and they took refuge in Louisiana.

A similar migration occurred in the mid-1800s when French Canadians left Quebec to come to New England for economic opportunity, and you can see the ancestral birthplace dots reflecting that movement.

Now here’s a map depicting the same thing for the entire American continent. You can see that at Generation 0 (the ones getting the DNA test), they all are in cities, but their parents fill out the countryside. A clear western migration over the centuries. https://t.co/JGmMTAGpxb

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmepWAXwAIEh34.jpg)

But since many of the White ancestors came over the last three centuries, they also include a map of ancestral birthplaces in Europe. You can see that the English, Scotch, and Irish were always coming to America, but some, for example the French, largely stopped near Gen. 5. https://t.co/NHDE3ixIbD

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmesgDX0AYQpDL.jpg)

Now we can go into specific ancestries of the five major sub-races. We begin with Pennsylvania. At this point, though, I must explain the Odds Ratio (OR). The dots here are SIZED according to the number of ancestral birthplaces at that location. https://t.co/buGsExMLTw

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRme3pPWYAICwu5.jpg)

The dots are *colored* according to their odds ratio (OR) value, which shows “the proportion of ancestral birth locations [reported by] cluster members at that map location over the proportion [reported by] non-cluster members at the same location.” So if you see a blue dot in Middle Pennsylvania, indicating a high OR for that cluster, it *does not* mean that that geographical area of PA is the main contributor of admixture to the Pennsylvania cluster, but that the people born in that location will more likely show up exclusively in the PA cluster, and not in other clusters. When dots get smaller in size, it shows a smaller OR value, indicating that people from that area can belong to one cluster or the other in almost equal proportions.

Britain, for example, has large dots, indicating a large contribution to the PA admixture. But other clusters also report British ancestry, so the dots are NOT EXCLUSIVE to PA. This prevents them from being red.

However, we know that early in Pennsylvania’s history, it was settled by large numbers of Germans (50,000 settled in 1760 alone). This is reflected in Germany’s large dots (lots of ancestral birthplaces) and high OR value (the ancestors born there went exclusively to PA).

The Pennsylvanian race comes primarily from Britain and Germany, and secondly from around Western and Northern Europe. Let’s examine the Northeast and Utah cluster.

There are actually two maps here: one centered on New England, and one on Utah. https://t.co/OxCkuAB4Wc

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmfNv5XoAAseh6.jpg)

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmfPdFXwAMAYz9.jpg)

New England shows large migrations from Britain, Ireland, and Germany, but also that many of the immigrants from all over Europe came to N.E. alone. As expected, because people weren’t migrating to Lexington or Savannah, but to New York.

The Northeast, then, is a wide mixture of all Europe. Utah is a different story. The Utahians report their ancestry coming from New England, England, and Denmark. Few came directly from Europe to Utah, but the Utahians mostly derive from the Northeast US, so anything is possible.

For the following regions, unless otherwise stated, they derive ancestry from those six colonial nations listed above: England, Germany, Scotland, Ireland, France, the Netherlands. https://t.co/8dezv3e9oN

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmfiBcWUAAgmjb.jpg)

The South as a Whole.

Most Southerners only trace their ancestry to other parts of the South, not to Europe. This indicates that the South was not a destination of later European migrants, but remained the home of the original colonists, only concerned with itself. https://t.co/oscZIRDEvW

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmfpS2WUAEsOk3.jpg)

The Upper South.

This region encompasses the westward expansion of Virginia into Tennessee, across Arkansas and Oklahoma, and into Texas. They again only trace ancestry to themselves, with moderate immigration from the six European nations. Many come from the Western Carolinas. https://t.co/dIRTvydP4u

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmfxexXsAIUdam.jpg)

The Lower South.

From the coastal Carolinas, these settlers swept along Florida, Mississippi, and Alabama into Eastern Texas. In 1814, the Creek Indians were expelled, and “Alabama Fever” gripped many South Carolinans. A similar migration occurred in 1820s Georgia and Florida. https://t.co/de3ZWFFJRV

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmgIOqWYAERqMf.jpg)

Notice that Cajun Louisiana does not show migration into the rest of the South, nor vice versa. French Louisiana has been an ethnic enclave for a long time.

Appalachia.

Most Appalachians trace their ancestry only to Appalachia, showing great insulation. Those who go to the Appalachians, stay in the Appalachians, with some spreading to the Lower Midwest. This region forms almost an ethnostate centered around the Cumberland Mountains. https://t.co/R4v1McmAiW

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmg_DoXoAE0KQS.jpg)

We also have maps showing how each of these regions expanded from the original colonies into the American continent. https://t.co/05Qq8AGXYx

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmhLDmWYAYHfK_.jpg)

We will now delve into the smaller micro-races of the United States. Some are noticeable, some are hidden; some try to maintain an ethnostate, some are isolated by lifestyle alone. Either way, they are identifiably different from the five main sub races.

#1 MORMONS

Perhaps the best known group, those settlers which formed a new religion and set off to Utah are still the prime inhabitants of that western land. From what I know of Mormon history, the movement began in upstate New York, which is shown in their New England ancestry. https://t.co/3td9z3oxbN

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmgj1gXIAESuWs.jpg)

Additionally, a large number of Mormons descend from England (mainly West), Scotland around Edinburgh, and from Denmark. Remember that the red dots means that most East Danes went EXCLUSIVELY into Mormon communities.

We can also trace the movement of the Mormons through maps like the one below, which shows where the ancestors of modern Mormons were born generations ago. https://t.co/wtS64Ieoql

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmg8e9XIAoN_IR.jpg)

Overall, Mormons are members of the New England race, but simply isolated out west.

#2 THE AMISH

The Amish of PA, NY, and OH, primarily trace their heritage to those same states (very heavily in some areas, but also to Germany and Switzerland. In fact, it seems like all immigrants from Bern, Switzerland became Amish. https://t.co/99VJ4XsOiY

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmhUCeXwAETBi3.jpg)

#3 THE IRISH

The Irish have dispersed most heavily around the Northeast, but in some areas they remained so overwhelming that they are still detectable, as in Chicago and in Nova Scotia. In other places, like Massachusetts, they’ve assimilated quite well with other Whites. https://t.co/RRJ8GUNcFm

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmhde9WYAcv25u.jpg)

In fact, the study breaks down the American spread of Irish genes by region of Ireland, North, South, and West. The result, though, is a quite even spread. https://t.co/q188adgczI

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmiJjkWQAYz3p5.jpg)

#4 SCANDINAVIANS AND FINNS

Of course, the Vikings of the Midwest. Almost all settlers from Norway, Finland, Poland and most from Sweden, went straight to Wisconsin, Minnesota, and North Dakota, along with some settling in the more developed NE. https://t.co/Wg9LgLxpwR

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmiPxPWYAMLp86.jpg)

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmiQ0CXIAI9Cy7.jpg)

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmiTOLXIAEqtRL.jpg)

It appears that Scandinavian supremacy is so complete in that part of the Midwest that Minnesota is simply Norse clay. The red dots show that few other ethnicities exist there.

#5 NUEVOS MEXICANOS

Descended from the European Spanish settlers of New Mexico, this enclave makes up the primary ancestry of New Mexican ethnos. These are not Mexicans, but have been here since the Spanish settlement along the “Camino Real de Tierra Adentro” trail since 1598. https://t.co/tAOvwWQk1n

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmigGDXoAEsK3R.jpg)

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmil8PXwAE_w_Z.jpg)

#6 MENNONITES

This sparse community began through homesteading on the Great Plains in the 1800s, and now find themselves centered around Kansas, Oklahoma, and Nebraska. They come England, Scotland, Germany, and exclusively from East Germany and parts of Sweden. https://t.co/9v3pGqQjZ1

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmjAjRX0AMLOUm.jpg)

#7 FRENCH CANADIANS AND ACADIANS

The piece of Quebec attached to NE is occupied by Frenchmen of every region, from the English Channel to the Mediterranean. Acadians are those French of Nova Scotia and Louisiana. They hold all of Southern LA, and the southern tips of MS and AL. https://t.co/dnLzp1vBsE

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmjVn6XEAI7XQ1.jpg)

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmjfgyXsAIzoLn.jpg)

#8 APPALACHIANS

We’ve seen Cumberland Appalachians before, but the researchers bring them up again because they stand out at every level of detail as a total ethnostate. They report almost no ancestry anywhere but within Appalachia, even 9 generations back. https://t.co/88jRCNHpND

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmjjovWUAEYW0E.jpg)

#9 SCOTS

Separate from the Scotch-Irish and the Highland Scots elsewhere in America, the Scots as a cluster show up linked to Nova Scotia and the Atlantic Islands in Canada, along with the Toronto area of Canada. https://t.co/FHer9GRPWn

![Tweet Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmjoQVXsAI5aRE.jpg)

Finally, we are given admixture analyses for all groups at all levels of detail. You can see that for White Americans, admixture comes from Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia, and Western Europe. The insinuation that Whites all have a black or Indian ancestor is a lie. https://t.co/11FqRptmlt

I truly recommend coming back to the three charts above to prove or disprove any racial admixture in the American population. They're quite good.

We've discussed a lot of smaller races, but again I'd like to reiterate that, as shown above, the predominant substrate in American Whites is England, Wales, Scotland. Secondary admixtures: Irish, German, Scandinavian, French.

Many people who came over after the Revolution were of the same original race as the earliest settlers, and blended in completely in a short time. I don't take "length of time in America" as a determinant factor from a genetics standpoint.

In addition, yesterday @SupremeDeist put out a good thread on the early race wars between Indians and White Americans. You should read.

I did mistakenly leave out the Italians of NY/NJ. Here is their ancestry map. They remain quite clustered in the NYC area but have diffused somewhat through the Northeast.
