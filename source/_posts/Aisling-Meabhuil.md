| Aisling Meabhuil | An Illusive Vision |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Aisling meabhuil d'aicill mh'anam,[^1] seal gan tapa seang tím tréith; | An illusive vision troubled my soul for a time, leaving me without vigour, lean, spiritless, and prostrate: |
| Frasa carb trasna mara ag[^2] teacht andeas go ceann faoi réim; | Showers of ships crossing the sea from the south, mightily and in due order, |
| Dragain mheara a d-tosahc cata a n-airm ghreanta an t-seang t-síol[^3] Chéin, | Nimble soldiers in the battle-front, in splendid arms—the graceful race of Cian— |
| Leagadh air ghallaibh aca is bargadh, is fearann fairsing a g-ceann críoch Néill. | Upsetting and wounding the foreigners, and wide their plains at the extremity of the regions of Niall. |

| Mars gan bhanna dearcaim, seabhac leabhair lannach leabhair-ghníomh tréan, | I beheld a Mars without censure, a warrior of the sword, of nimble deeds, mighíy, |
| Bracach asgnaimh,[^4] coileach catha, d'aicme Raithleann sean ghríb Gaedheal; | A marching banner, a battle cock, of the race of Raithlean, parent oí the warriors of the Gael; |
| Críthid flaithis, bailte, daingin, ranna, mara, is campaoi a g-céin, | The heavens tremble, towns, strongholds, continents, seas, and camps in the distance |
| D'fheartaibh arm-ghairge an aicil gheallas ceart an t-seanrígh phléidh.[^5] | At the feats of martial valour of the hero who undertook to fight for the rights of the old king. |

[^1]: "m'anam". This aspiration is common in the spoken language. aicill, from aiciollaim, “I vex." O.R. writes it aigiollaim: d'aicill mh'anam gan tapa, "vexed my soul, leaving it, or rather me, without vigour."
[^2]: ag. In MSS. freguently aig.
[^3]: t-seang t-síol. A t-seang-síol.
[^4]: bratach asgnaimh, “banner of progress or marching.” asgnaimh, from asgnaim, “I go, march.” M, brotach aisnimh. A, also, aisnimh. Ibid. Raithleann was foster-mother of Corc of Cashel, and daughter of Dathe the strong. Corc being the first king of Cashel, descent from the Cashel kings is spoken of as descent from Raithleann.
[^5]: pléidh generally means “to litigate, to contend ”; here it is used of battle.
