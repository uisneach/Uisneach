| Créaċta Críċ Fódla[^0] | The Wounds of Fodla |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Is atuirseaċ gear liom créaċta críċ Fódla[^1] | Woeful and bitter to me are the wounds of the land of Fodla, |
| Fá sgamall[^2] go daor ‘sa gaolta clí-ḃreóiġte; | Who is sorely under a cloud whilst her Kinsfolk are heartsick; |
| Na cranna baḋ ṫréine[^3] ag déanaṁ dín dóiḃ sin | The trees that were strongest in affordine them shelter |
| Do gearraḋ a ngéaga[^4] ‘r a b-préaṁa crín-feoiġte. | Have their branches lopped off and their roots withering in decay. |
|  |  |

|  |  |
| Cé fada ḋuit, 'Éire,[^5] ṁaorḋa, ṁín-nósṁar, | Long though thou hast been, O majestic, gentle-mannered Erin, |
| Ad’ ḃanaltrain t-séiṁ le féile is fíor-eólus, | A fair nursing-mother with hospitality and true knowledge; |
| Beir feasda ad’ ṁéirdrig fé gaċ críon-ċóisir, | Henceforth shalt thou be an unwilling handmaid to every withered band, |
| ‘S gaċ ladrann coṁaiṫeaċ[^6] b’éis do ċlí ḋeóltaḋ. | While every foreign boor shall have sucked thy breasts. |
|  |  |
<br>
|  |  |
| Is mar ḃarra air mo ṁéala, feuċ gur díol deóra, | And to crown my sorrow, behold it is a fit subject for tears, |
| Go ngaḃann gaċ récs don réim sin Roinn Eoruip[^7] | That every King of the dynasties who divide Europe amongst them  |
| A ḃairrḟionn tais féin go saoġalta síṫeóilte, | Possesses his own fair, gentle spouse in prosperity and peace, |
| Aċt banba a b-péin gan céile is í posda! | While Banba is in pain without a consort, wedded though she be. |
|  |  |
<br>
|  |  |
| Ċailleamar préim-ṡlioċt Néill is síol Eogain, | We have lost the root-stock of Niall and the seed of Eoghan, |
| Is na fearaċoin tréana, laoċraḋ ríoġaċt Bóirṁe, | And the bold champions, the warriors of the kingdom of Borumha; |
| Don Ċaraṫ’ ḟuil ḟéil, mo léun, ní’l puinn béo aguinn! | Of the hospitable race of Carthach, woe is me! we have not many alive, |
| Is fada sinn tréiṫ fá léir-sgrios buiḋin Leópald. | And long have we been helpless under the devastation of Leopold’s band. |
|  |  |
<br>
|  |  |
| Is dearḃ gur b’é gaċ éigion íogcóra, | In sooth it is every violence of injustice on our part, |
| Ganguid is éiṫeaċ, claon is díoṫ-ċóṁall, | Deceit and falsehood and treachery and dishonesty, |
| Gan ceangal le ċéile, aċt raobaḋ rínn-sgórnaċ, | Our want of union, and, instead, the tearing of each other’s throats, |
| Do ṫarraing go faoḃraċ fraoċ an Ríoġ ċoṁaċtaig. | That have drawn down on us keenly the rage of the Mighty King. |
|  |  |
<br>
|  |  |
| Ó ċailleamar Éire is méad ár mío-ċoṁṫrom, | Since we have lost Erin, and because of the extent of our misfortunes, |
| Is treasgairt na laoċ mear, treun, nár ṁí-ṫreóraċ, | And because of the overthrow of the nimble, strong warriors, who were not wanting in vigour, |
| Air Arad-Ṁac Dé ‘s air ṫreun na Tríonóide | We entreat the noble Son of God and the Might of the Trinity, |
| Go mairfiḋ bá n-éir an mead so ḋíoḃ beó aguinn. | That those of them who are alive with us may thrive after them. |
|  |  |
<br>
|  |  |
| Ċailleadar Gaoḋail a d-tréiṫe caoin córaċ, | The Gaels have lost their gentle, comely qualities; |
| Carṫanaċt, féile, beusa, is bínn-ċeólta; | Charity, hospitality, manners, and sweet music; |
| Alla-tuirc claon do ṫraoċ sinn faoi ṁór-smaċt; | Wicked, alien boars it was that forced us under great oppression; |
| Agallaim Aon-Ṁac Dé air Gaoiḋil d’fóirṫin. | I beseech the Only Son of God to grant relief to the Gaels. |


[^0]: Of this poem there are several partial copies. There is a copy containing all the stanzas given here in vol. 69 of the Renehan MSS. in Maynooth College. The piece, however, seems naturally to end with the sixth stanza. 23.C.8, p.99, gives as heading: "An fear céadna cct. iar mbrise na gcoinġoill do Ġallaiḃ do ro Ġealladar i Luimneach 1692." In 23.D.8. styled "Marna na hĖireann."
[^1]: Some MSS. read *Is atuirseaċ géar*. *Críċ Fódla* is taken as one word, hence *críċ* is not put in gen. The dat. (*críċ*) is often used instead of the nom. (*críoċ*) in nouns belonging to the second decl.
[^2]: sgamail, D.8.
[^3]: ba ṫréan, B.38. *Na cranna*, metaphorical for "great families."
[^4]: A ngéag. Most MSS. have the pl. *géaga*, which gives an extra syllable. Some have *géaḋa*, a softened form of *géaga*. *Crín Feóiġte* in some MSS.
[^5]: 'Éire, for *a Éire*, the *a* being absorbed by the initial vowel.
[^6]: Caéṫaċ for *coiṁiġṫeaċ*, generally pron. *caoiṫeaċ*.
[^7]: Roinn Eóroip, the Continent of Europe; it is not declined. *Deréim ċirt*, of the true sovereignty. *Gaċ récs*, all the kings.
