&lt;p&gt;“Chinese have always lived in houses, yes, if that’s all you mean by ‘civilization’… Everything for oneself, everything for personal utility: a pleasure in cruelty toward the weak and toward animals.” -BAP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People argue over civilization without first understanding what they speak of. I wonder if some modern nations have ever truly had civilization, but it might be better to ask if we have it presently. Our word “civilization” descends from the Latin “civitas”, and its meaning hasn’t drifted far. The common understanding is that a “civilized” society is non-hostile to its neighbors or to strangers, it is productive, introspective, and cohesive among its members. It produces and enjoys culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Roman idea of civitas is not much different on the surface, but utterly foreign underneath. To the early Romans, the world was hostile. In their early years, every summer a different neighbor launched a raid against their city, usually from loosely organized hill-tribes. These hill-tribes are not civilizations, not cities, and do not cultivate civitas. Sometimes it’s not hill-tribes but Gaulish war bands that come raiding, nevertheless, the countryside was full of danger from mobile bands of young warriors wanting to raid and kill. This behavior is Indo-European, but it is not civilized. When these roving tribes did&lt;br&gt;settle, it was in familial arrangements, villages so small that everyone was related. Some parts of Europe and western America may still know this type of settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Romans conquered the Aequi tribe, for instance, their settlements were so small they didn’t even warrant naming. In the Aeneid, Virgil calls the Aequi “a nation of rude mountaineers, addicted to the chase and to predatory habits, by which they sought to supply the deficiencies of their rugged and barren soil.” These were hunter-gatherers in the Italian Apennine Mountains. Rome subjugated the Aequi and caused them to exit their family homesteads (some may say, their longhouses) to form larger settlements, which became cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might call the Aequi “civilized”, but can you impose the virtue of Civitas onto another people? Authentic civitas must rise from within. Civitas is that virtue which causes cities to rise from villages of their own accord. The Aequi familial homesteads were bound together by family ties, not by civitas. Likewise sprawling modern cities aren’t held together by civitas, but by economic convenience. People move in and float away as money demands, without loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civic state, by contrast, isn’t held together by blood or money but by the ideal of a society. The powerful families of the familial villages coalesce to form a larger civil society, founded on a common dream or ideal. A Romulus figure appears to inspire a common aspiration into them. The underclasses follow suit. We see that first the aristocratic classes form the idea of a city, and thus birth the city’s daemon, it’s over-spirit; then the city begins to live, populated by lesser men who cannot follow a vision as well as the aristocrats might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Athens was ruled by the &lt;em&gt;Eupatridae&lt;/em&gt;, powerful men who kept the city alive in its spirit, grew its economy, and led wars to defend it. Utterly loyal to the place they ruled through their civitas (or άρετέ). Later these became the &lt;em&gt;Pentekosiomidemnoi&lt;/em&gt;, which fulfilled the same role. This old aristocracy was formed as a league of powerful military men who would lead the city with personal care and attention to its virtue and citizenry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aristocratic man’s willingness to uphold the city and its ideal is the first sign of civitas. The city isn’t formed around convenience, or led passively, slowly, and receptively; its purpose is to fulfill a dream and therefore must be active, swift, and powerful. These virtues are only characteristic of the most virtuous men of the society, never of its underclasses. But the underclasses become charged with the same energy and purpose as is put forward by their leadership, and thereby improve themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many cities in the ancient world and even more in the modern world are bereft of civic spirit at all. No virtuous leaders, and so no virtuous populace. Entire nations go without civitas and have no true cities. Urban housing becomes mere slave quarters for global finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are two opposing ends of the civilizational cycle. On the one end is the most basic family structure, the homestead or longhouse. On the other end is the overdeveloped metropolis. The metropolis occurs once the power struggles between small cities are ended, and a single larger state becomes dominant. Just as family ideals are subsumed into the city-state, civic ideals are subsumed into the nation or empire, and usually a secretive class of oligarchs, lacking courage or loyalty, dominates. Civitas is overtaken by patriotism, or by some other more generalized virtue showing adherence to symbols only. The countryside is made safe by the state’s power, and the affairs of the state become too large for a single man to effectively engage in. Men can understand a city and care for a city, but the benefits which one receives through civic care are diminished as the city’s influence grows. The city is no longer the sole interest of the men who live in it; it becomes the interest of everyone under its power as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take Rome as an example: the streets had filled with the poor who were forced from the countryside, who had no virtue and wanted only bread. The nobles who once would fight against the city’s decay could move to their villas in Campania. Poor living conditions in Rome and the homogenization of neighboring cities meant that the upper artisanal classes and merchants could move to other Italian cities with minimal difficulty. In the end, no one was left to care for Rome herself, and the only interests left were those of personal gain. Most often this personal wealth was acquired by using Rome as a skinsuit, pretending that there still was a Rome when her people had abandoned her or when German barbarians moved in. Perhaps the economy kept growing, but Civilization had ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in late Rome, we live in a metropolis which is deprived of personality in favor of function. The people who live in the city are deprioritized in favor of the more wealthy people who travel or commute to the city from outside. As I said, the city becomes a skinsuit for outsiders. The city is no longer a place in itself, with beauty and identity, but only a hub for economic convenience. Likewise, the economic wheels require slaves to work them, and now everywhere we see newly-made highrise apartments where high-salaried tech workers and diversity officers can waste money living the fake glamor of the “urban lifestyle.” This genre of housing which fills most modern cities can only be called slave quarters for the minions of the economic rulers of our fallen cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Civitas is what makes a wattle and daub village into a city, then we have almost no cities left. They’ve been gutted. Even if men had civitas blazing in their hearts, what cities are left to care for or participate in? Globalism is a crusade against this very feeling. If we want cities and civitas to return, we can’t revive it from what we have now. There aren’t even family villages to act as the seeds of a city. So, we must create them. Civitas demands regard and respect for the forebears of the city and its ancestors. At some point, we must become the men whom our descendants will honor. Ancient families enshrined their forebears as household spirits so as to never neglect them or their ideals. How to achieve this? BAP tells us our instincts for piracy and warbands will rise again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginnings of a family village, one which can cultivate a noble line and act as the estate of the pater familias, lie in the leader of the war band claiming land for his own and destroying his enemies. We can find suitable places for this in the less civilized parts of the earth. The civilized parts are merely domesticated now. You must see this, because nowhere is there civitas among the people. Not true civitas, but only its echo, the afterimage of goodwill towards neighbors but never the will to go to war for your city against others. This lack of feeling is a historical aberration which won’t last forever. A day will come when civitas returns to the far reaches of the Western world, if not due to visionary men, then due to the necessity against enemies!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to the greatest point on the nature of the civic virtue: the core unit of civitas, without which it cannot function, is friendship between men. This is what binds the Indo-European &lt;em&gt;kóryos&lt;/em&gt; as well as the city-state. It is another reason men have come under attack today. A city inhabited by men who feel loyalty to each other and to their city is much harder to manipulate than a city of atomized individuals. The training of the city’s young boys was of the utmost importance, and every city of note in the Classical and Christian eras alike instituted rituals to initiate their boys into patriotic manhood. This is the purpose of the famous Spartan agoge, for instance. The great bureaucracies of today want men without friends, without a permanent home, without roots, and without the courage to fight. If the Greeks could see modern men, who allow their cities to be uprooted, humiliated, and defiled without consequences, they would be filled with existential grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the virtues in life tie into one another. Loyalty, friendship, and civitas stand side by side. When you cultivate one, you encourage the others. Therefore if we want to see the rise of new and powerful cities, we must first show loyalty to friends, and courage towards our ideal. You are the city. Without this, the world will remain an undifferentiated grey mass.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&#34;The-Genetic-Makeup-of-the-Great-American-Race&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#The-Genetic-Makeup-of-the-Great-American-Race&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;The Genetic Makeup of the Great American Race&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Genetic Makeup of the Great American Race&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2022/04/30/AmericanGenetics/Boones-First-View-of-Kentucky-William-Renney.jpg&#34; class=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;Background&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Background&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Background&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, “American” is a race, or rather, a family of smaller races which find their origins among Enagland and Wales, Scotland, Ireland, France, Germany, Denmark, and Norway. There are other populations in the United States today, but I will be focusing on the American race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the earliest times, the American race has been a mirror of Western and Northern Europe in the New World. A proposed seal for the United States, drawn in 1776 by Pierre du Simitière, is shown below, which shows the six nations which were taken as the origin of the colonial American population: England (and Wales), Scotland, Ireland, France, Holland, and Germany. As we will see, this characterization is accurate. Some people will try to convince you that America was an Anglo-Saxon ethnostate before Germans, Irish, and Italians moved in. This is not true. Britain has, however, always been the largest substrate for most of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genetics paper this article is drawing data from is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14238&#34;&gt;“Clustering of 770,000 genomes reveals post-colonial population structure of North America”&lt;/a&gt; by Han et al, published in Nature on Feb 7, 2017. These researchers took 769,444 DNA samples from Ancestry.com data; 96% of the people sampled had ancestors who were born within the US. From this dataset, we get a canvas showing the large swaths of White American population movement surrounded by a smattering of niche genetic groups across the continent, including Caribbeans, Acadians, and Mexicans. On Ancestry.com, you can also set your ‘pedigree’, or the locations your ancestors were born. This is a great help, because we can now identify the movement of people over time, not simply where they are now. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All data and figures in this writeup come from this paper or its supplementary material.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Most samples are from California, followed by New York and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmY0KDWUAIHqqs.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sample Origins by State&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Number of DNA samples with reported birth locations in US states. These numbers are obtained from pedigree nodes linked to DNA samples. Note that the counts by US state don&#39;t add up to the total number of US born samples because &#34;US born&#34; also includes Puerto Rico, Guam and other US territories.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study traces ‘identity-by-descent’ (IBD) data to create their genetic clusters. An IBD analysis tracks DNA segments that are not merely similar, but are descended from the same ancestor. This is a sample of how clusters are calculated across individuals in this sizeable dataset. This method works best for populations that are not relatively diverse and in which one segment of the genome can occur within numerous participants, which would show descent from a common ancestor within recent generations. Testing between two random Americans is not ideal, since for the last few centuries barriers to mating have been very low, but this dataset overcomes this through its sheer size, and the researchers are able to perform this analysis nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Pedigree, recombination and resulting IBD segments, schematic representation.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;Genetic-Affinities&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Genetic-Affinities&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Genetic Affinities&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Genetic Affinities&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First let’s inspect the genetic affinities between groups, starting with the PCA distribution. Below we see participants grouped into states and mapped based on genetic similarity. For the non-initiated, distance in this graphic roughly represents total genetic distance between populations. You can see that California, New York, and Texas are largest, followed by PA, MI, and IL, etc. The far Northeast and the Deep South both form highly differentiated clusters (ethnostates?) forming two ends of the spectrum. The Mid-Atlantic and Upper South cluster closer to the West of the country. We can already see historic movements: notice that Utah is close to New York, a remnant of Mormonism’s origins in upstate NY before moving out west. See how the French of Louisiana drag their state towards the French Canadians of New England. These clusters will color all future maps in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmauz2WYAAlP7T.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PCA Chart&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&#34;Principal components (PCs) are computed using kernel PCA, in which the kernel matrix is defined by total IBD between pairs of states, normalized to remove the effect of variation in within-state IBD. US states that share high levels of IBD on average are placed closer to each other in the projection onto the first two principal components. The area of each circle is scaled by number of self-reported birth locations in the state (Supplementary Fig. 1). US states are coloured by geographic region (Northeast, South, Midwest and West).&#34;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary map is below, the one which merits reposting again and again. The DNA data clusters into the groups shown above, which are then color-coded here based on genetic similarity only, not geographic origin. Those groups are the American sub-races. But what does this graphic show? There are three things going on with each dot: color, size, and location. The dot does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; represent a participant in this study, but rather the participant’s parents or other ancestors. Each dot’s location show the participant’s &lt;em&gt;parent’s&lt;/em&gt; birthplace. Size indicates the number of birth locations reported for that area. Color represents the nearest genetic cluster which participants from that area associate with. So if you’re DNA clustered with the blue datapoints, you would likely be from Pennsylvania, if yellow, likely from the coastal South. Also, dots are only counted when their OR is above a threshold value, giving the appearance of a mostly empty West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside that larger map is another showing smaller clusters or sub-races which the researchers picked up in finer detail. See: American blacks, Mormons, New York Jews, Amish, and Appalachistanis, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fncomms14238/MediaObjects/41467_2017_Article_BFncomms14238_Fig3_HTML.jpg?as=webp&#34; alt=&#34;Distribution of ancestral birth locations in North America associated with IBD clusters.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Fig. 3: &#34;Points show pedigree birth locations that are disproportionately assigned to each cluster. Only birth locations with OR&gt;x within indicated generations y–z are plotted, in which parameters x, y, z are chosen separately per cluster to better visualize the cluster&#39;s historical geographic concentration; full distributions of ancestral birth locations in the United States, Europe and worldwide are given in Supplementary Figs. 18–20. For each cluster, points are independently scaled by the number of pedigree annotations. See Fig. 2 and Table 1 for more details. Note that clusters are separated into two maps only for clarity. Also note that the concentration of Puerto Rican ancestors in Hawaii probably reflects their arrival there in the early 1900s (ref. 64).&#34;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There we have it: the five largest genetic groups of America are New England &amp;amp; Utah, Pennsylvania&amp;#x2F;Ohio&amp;#x2F;New Jersey, Lower Midwest&amp;#x2F;Appalachia, Upper Mountain South, and Lower Coastal South. Most classic Americans come from one or some of these races. We can also see a pattern of settlement from America’s early days: the coastal population of the colonial South swept along the Gulf coast from the Carolinas along Florida, Alabama, to settle at the far end Louisiana and East Texas. Meanwhile the Appalachian South spread across the mountains to reach Tennessee, Arkansas, and eventually Central Texas. Early Virginians spread through the mountains to south Ohio and Indiana, meanwhile Pennsylvanians went to East Ohio and (what would later be) West Virginia (a newfound explanation for that state’s siding with the Union and breaking from VA? [but notice the small dot size, indicating almost equal settlement from each cluster]). And Michiganders belong with New Englanders, which coincides with well-known early Yankee migration in the 1820s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this map above we also get these charts showing mean locations for pedigree reports for each major group for hte last few generations. We can clearly see that even four generations ago, each group was heavily vertically stratified, and remains so to this day, but which has dispersed slightly as time went on; apparently “Go West Young Man” was taken as a maxim. Longitudinally, we can trace a clear western migration through the moving of the mean longitude and a dispersal through the movement of the horizontal bars. Now we have a time element for these migrations: coastal Southerners spread quickly along the Gulf Coast. One generation ago there was a great spreading across the country, possibly as historical populations centers and cities became unliveable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fncomms14238/MediaObjects/41467_2017_Article_BFncomms14238_Fig5_HTML.jpg?as=webp&#34; alt=&#34;Five largest clusters predict North-South US geography across multiple generations&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Fig. 5: &#34;In a, each circle gives the mean latitude (in degrees) of all pedigree birth location annotations within a given generation linked to genotypes assigned to each of the five clusters; end points of vertical bars represent 10th and 90th empirical percentiles. These statistics are compiled from pedigree annotations with US birth locations only. Note that ‘0 generations ago’ refers to genotyped individuals. For contrast, b shows the same statistics, but for longitude instead of latitude. Each degree of longitude or latitude is roughly equivalent to 100 km. Examples of US cities by latitude and longitude include Boston, MA (42.4, −71.1), New Orleans, LA (30.0, −90.1) and Sacramento, CA (38.6, −121.5).&#34;&lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hidden in the Supplementary Material are the following spectral embedding analyses. These show divergence of each specialty cluster from the rest of the dataset, for example we can see the divergence of both Puerto Ricans and Jews from the main cluster. In figure (g) you can see a small divergence of Appalachistanis from the main genetic body. We can see that, for example, Northeast Mexicans and New Mexicans share some affinity, but are still dinstinct, possibly convergin in the Spanish Nuevomexicano population still living in New Mexico, which we will see later; or that Hawaiians and Colombians are about as divergent as possible. See how Acadians are contiguous with French Canadians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice also that Irish, Scandinavian, Mennonites, Amish etc. are separated in the table above and in the spectral embedding. Why is that? I thought Irish and Amish would be contiguous with mainline Americans? It’s not because they don’t make up a component of the American Race, but because in some areas they’ve remained so isolated it’s possible to draw them out from other clusters, as they are in these charts. See how we can draw out Utah Mormons from the mainline population in the same way, due to their isolation. These spectral analysis charts show how differentiated from the mean each ethnos goes: Jews and Africans are very distinct from Americans, while Scandinavians, Amish, Irish, and Mormons are distinct but not very divergent, most likely due to similar origin populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;Genetic-Origins&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Genetic-Origins&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Genetic Origins&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Genetic Origins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Americans like to know their origins in the Old World. Let’s see some global admixture data on the groups presented here. See the column below ‘Global Admixture’ and see that most of the American population groups at the bottom are simply ‘Western European’. Specialty groups like Irish, Portuguese, Scandinavians can be pinned down to precise regions in Europe, but average Americans cannot be located so precisely. Later we will look into more finely grained origin maps to see exactly the regions in Europe that contribute admixture to the American genome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRma4r6WUAAj0_N.png&#34; alt=&#34;Global Admixture Table&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&#34;ACB, African Caribbean in Barbados; ASW, people with African Ancestry in Southwest USA; CEU, Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry; CLM, Colombians from Medellin, Colombia; FIN, Finnish in Finland; MXL, Mexican ancestry from Los Angeles; Nat. Am., Native American; PUR, Puerto Rican. Rows are grouped to coincide with the discussion. Admixture statistics are expressed as d&gt;x, Pin%, Pout%, meaning that Pin% individuals assigned to the cluster and Pout% outside the cluster have estimated admixture proportions for ancestral population d&gt;x. The ‘1000 Genomes’ column summarizes population labels of any 1000 Genomes samples that project onto the same stable subsets defined in spectral embedding.&#34; &lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what is Western Europe here? How defined? Luckily the researchers provide us an answer in this map. It covers Madrid to Warsaw, and a sliver of southern England to include an English sample in that region. ‘Great Britain’ encloses all of the Netherlands and most of northern France, half of Ireland. Clearly these are genetic regions, not strict political borders, to account for similarities between neighbors, ancient migrations, etc. Thankfully in the Supplementary Material, they give us additional maps in fine geographic detail, which we will review later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we are about to dive into a long series of maps going into extreme detail on the migratory patterns of these American sub-races. First, following the researchers, let’s examine a sub-race as practice: Cajuns, Acadians, and French Canadians. Blue dots are ancestors of modern Acadians&amp;#x2F;Cajuns, and magenta dots show ancestors of French Canadians&amp;#x2F;Québécois. See here how many Cajuns and Acadians list their ancestors from 1649 - 1791 as being born still in France, alongside those in Louisiana and French Canada. 1791, of course, is the year that Britain established &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Canada&#34;&gt;Lower Canada&lt;/a&gt;, which combined with the pressure of the French Revolution and the attractiveness of the new continent, spurred the settlement of Quebec. By 1878 we see most French Canadians had already arrived, and by 1962 many had moved to New England as well. Notice how between the 6-9th generations and the 3-5th generations, the large collection of blue dots had moved from Nova Scotia to Louisiana. This is due to the British &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_the_Acadians&#34;&gt;expulsion the Acadians from Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt;, after which they took refuge in Louisiana. Notice that Cajun Louisiana does not show migration into the rest of the South, nor vice versa. French Louisiana has been an ethnic enclave for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Fig. 4: &#34;Map locations are plotted if OR&gt;10 within the indicated range of pedigree generations (date ranges give the 5th and 95th percentiles of birth year annotations).

&lt;p&gt;Now here’s a map depicting the same thing for the entire American continent. You can see that at Generation 0 (the ones who participated in the DNA test), they coalesce around cities, but their parents fill out the countryside, as do their grandparents and great-grandparents. From nine generations ago to four generations ago, we have Manifest Destiny, a clear western migration over the centuries. But between four and three generations ago, corresponding to the announcement of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_frontier#End_of_the_frontier&#34;&gt;close of the American frontier&lt;/a&gt;, we see that westward settlement largely ceases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmepWAXwAIEh34.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Distribution of birth locations in continental US, by generation&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Supp. Fig. 16: &#34;Distribution of birth locations in continental US, by generation. Generation 0 corresponds to the DNA sample, so should reflect the birth location distribution of (present-day) US-born AncestryDNA customers. Generation 1 corresponds to parents, generation 2 corresponds to grandparents, and so on. Ancestral birth locations in each pedigree generation are divided into a grid, with grid points every 0.5 degrees of latitude and longitude. Only locations with at least 20 pedigree nodes are shown on the map. The size of each point is scaled by the number of annotated pedigree nodes at that location, separately for each generation.&#34;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the American ancestors. But since many of America’s White ancestors came asynchronously over the last three centuries, the researchers also created a map of ancestral birthplaces in Europe based on Ancestry.com pedigree reporting. You can see that the English, Scotch, and Irish were always coming to America for the country’s entire history, Continental French and German immigration largely dried up two generations ago. But in the country’s earlier days, there was massive immigration from all Western European countries (save Spain, who had their own &lt;em&gt;hispanohablante&lt;/em&gt; countries to move to). French immigration seemingly slowed to a halt around five generations ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRmesgDX0AYQpDL.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Distribution of birth locations in Europe, by generation&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Supp. Fig. 17: &#34;Distribution of birth locations in Europe, by generation.&#34;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also go into specific ancestries of the five major sub-races, and later of the smaller genetic clusters. Let’s begin with Pennsylvania, the Mid-Atlantic strain. But in these maps the odds-ratio (OR) becomes more significant, so it is worth making sure all readers understand what this value means. The dots are &lt;em&gt;colored&lt;/em&gt; according to their odds ratio, which shows “the proportion of ancestral birth locations [reported by] cluster members at that map location over the proportion [reported by] non-cluster members at the same location.” So if you see a blue dot in Middle Pennsylvania, indicating a high OR for that cluster, it &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; mean that that geographical area of PA is the main contributor of admixture to the Pennsylvania cluster, but that the people born in that location will more likely show up exclusively in the PA cluster, and not in other clusters. And people born elsewhere are less likely to appear in the Pennsylvania cluster. When dots get smaller in size, it shows a smaller OR value, indicating that people from that area can belong to one cluster or the other in almost equal proportions. Britain, for example, has large dots here, indicating a large contribution to the PA admixture. But other clusters also report British ancestry, so the dots are &lt;em&gt;not exclusive&lt;/em&gt; to PA, which prevents them from being red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we know that early in Pennsylvania’s history, it was settled by large numbers of Germans (50,000 settled in 1760 alone). This is reflected in Germany’s large dots (lots of ancestral birthplaces) and relatively high OR value (the ancestors born there went largely to PA). The Pennsylvanian race comes primarily from Britain and Germany, and secondly from around Western and Northern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Supp. Fig. 19b &#34;Pennsylvania&#34;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s examine the Northeast and Utah cluster. There are actually two maps here: one centered on New England, and one on Utah. New England shows large migrations from Britain, Ireland, and Germany, but also that many of the immigrants from all over Europe came to N.E. alone. As expected, because people weren’t migrating to Lexington or Savannah, but to New York or Boston, or somewhere near those cities. For example, the red dots in Norway indicate that many Norweigian immigrants now cluster with the Northeast group, which is reflected in both New York and the obscure Norweigian communities of Passaic and Sussex county New Jersey. (We will see later about Norweigian migration to the Midwest, in which more of Norway is shown with high OR. What we see here seems to be exclusive immigration from certain villages, likely following family). The Northeast, then, after receiving waves of immigration into its cities, is a wide mixture of all Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utah is a different story. The Utahians report their ancestry coming from New England, England proper, and Denmark. Few came directly from England to Utah, but rather represent the last holdout of the ethnically pure English populations of colonial New England. Utah and its Danish component will be revisited later as we review enclave races.&lt;/p&gt;

This indicates that the South was not a destination of later European migrants, but remained the home of the original colonists, although you can see that some Mid-Atlantic colonists are represented here. In Europe they trace broadly across the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

They again primarily trace ancestry to themselves, but unlike the Lower South we see moderate immigration from the six European nations and from across the US. Many from the Western Carolinas still live along this path.&lt;/p&gt;

In 1814, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creek_War#Results&#34;&gt;the Creek Indians were expelled&lt;/a&gt; or forced to give up land, the opening-up of this territory and “Alabama Fever” gripped many South Carolinans which caused them to move in. A similar migration occurred in 1820-30s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/cherokee-removal/&#34;&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminole_Wars#First_Seminole_War&#34;&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; when Indians were expelled and Whites took their place. Notice again the separation between Anglo Louisiana and French Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;

Those who go to the Appalachians, evidently stay there, with some dispersion around the Lower Midwest. This region forms almost an ethnostate centered around the Cumberland Mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will now delve into the smaller and more exclusive micro-races of the United States. Some are noticeable, some are hidden; some try to maintain an ethnostate, some are isolated by lifestyle alone. Either way, they are identifiably different from the five main sub-races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;Mormons&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Mormons&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Mormons&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mormons&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best known group, those settlers which formed a new religion and set off to Utah are still the prime inhabitants of that western land. Additionally, a large number of Mormons descend from (mainly Midland and West) England, Scotland around Edinburgh, and from Denmark. Most Danes migrated &lt;em&gt;exclusively&lt;/em&gt; into Mormon communities and nowhere else in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also trace the movement of the Mormons through maps like the one below, which shows where the ancestors of modern Mormons were born generations ago. Overall, Mormons are members of the old New England sub-race, but simply isolated out west, insulated by both religion&amp;#x2F;lifestyle and geography.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, it seems like all immigrants from near Bern, Switzerland became Amish. The discrete nature of their settlements in America (i.e. Amish people tested report parentage from only specific communities) belies their peculiar rural lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

In other places, like Massachusetts, they’ve assimilated quite well with other Whites. You can see a number of Irish, or perhaps we should include the Scots by saying “Gaelic”, related people in Nove Scotia as well due to British colonization of the island in the colonial era.&lt;/p&gt;

Almost all settlers from Norway, Finland, Poland and most from Sweden, went straight to Wisconsin, Minnesota, and North Dakota, along with some settling in the more developed Northeast as mentioned earlier. It appears that Scandinavian supremacy is so complete in that part of the Midwest that Minnesota is simply Norse clay, and Iowa may be Swedish clay too. The red dots show that few other ethnicities exist there.&lt;/p&gt;

We’ve discussed a lot of smaller races, but again I’d like to reiterate that, as shown above, the predominant substrate in American Whites is England, Wales, Scotland. Secondary admixtures: Irish, German, Scandinavian, French. Many people who came over after the Revolution were of the same original race as the earliest settlers, and blended in completely in a short time. I personally don’t take “length of time in America” as a determinant factor towards Americanness from a genetics standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
